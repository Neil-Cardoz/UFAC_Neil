# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UFAC Engine (Uncertainty-First Agent Council) is a multi-agent AI system designed to help Indian citizens discover and apply for central government agriculture schemes. The system ingests scheme data from multiple sources, processes it into a vector store, and uses a council of specialized AI agents to provide accurate, confidence-calibrated recommendations about scheme eligibility. The system emphasizes transparency by explicitly surfacing uncertainties, assumptions, and missing information rather than hiding them.
